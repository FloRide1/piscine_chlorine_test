# Piscine_chlorine_test

## Install 
If you want to add this project make: (in your piscine folder)
```sh
git submodule add git@github.com:FloRide1/piscine_chlorine_test.git
```

Add in your `.gitignore`
```
# Remove chlorine test
*_test.c
```

If you want to use the clang-format (`make format`), you need to
have it install (not by default on PIE)

### Please respect the format
This is just a student base project for making test faster

### Coding Style
The coding style is not mandatory on this project ;)

## Rules:
- Test MUST be in a folder name exactly like the project folder
- Tests MUST be name respecting this regex: `*_test.c`
- Tests MUST be true (LOL)
- Code 

### Help:
```sh
./create_directory <folder_name> (OPTIONNAL:<file_name>)
```
